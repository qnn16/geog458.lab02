### Introduction

The narrative I chose for my research is about how different universities in Washington state are talked about. In my example, I chose the three largest universities in the state by campus size, University of Washington-Seattle, Washington State University, and Western Washington University. I chose to explore this topic in order to understand and compare the cultures between each of the different schools in the state. This is because of the differing locations of each of the schools and there's bound to be some similarities and differences within the cities that these schools are at.

> The parameters I used for each of the searches were the same or similar for each of the schools. I used the full university names, abbreviated names, and alternative names.

| UW | WSU | WWU
| ----------- | ----------- | -----------
| University of Washington Seattle | Washington State University | Western Washington University
| UW Seattle | WSU | WWU
| Univ of Washington Seattle | Wazzu | Western Washington University Bellingham

### Wordcloud

The wordcloud about UW includes a lot of words highlighting the social lifestyle at the campus, with many people opting to give tours of the campus or of their dorms/apartments. The word Seattle is also highlighted because UW is in the inner city of Seattle and influences the social life of the school.

WSU's wordcloud is much more heavy than UW with words involving sports, with mentions of coaches, basketball, football, and their rival team, the UW Huskies.

WWU has a wordcloud that seems like a balance between both UW and WSU. It seems to share similar words involving the social life of the campus of UW, such as "Love", "Life', "Tour", and etc. However, there is more of an emphasis on sports, as we can see with large "basketball" word.

### Conclusion
The outcome was similar to what I was expecting but not quite exact. I was expecting UW's wordcloud to be more sports heavy, such as with football, considering the team did so well this season. However, I think this was a result of various factors such as my search terms being a bit broad and with how the algorithm was searching for videos to input. The result for WSU was about what I expected since the only thing I've ever heard about WSU is football and that it's in a college town.
Overall, I'd say that the wordclouds turned out as I expected them to, but if I had to improve my research for another time, I would definitely narrow down my topic more to a more specific topic like sports or crime in order to draw better comparisons between the areas.
